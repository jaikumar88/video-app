Collaboration & Engagement FeaturesIDRequirementDescriptionFR-201Virtual Backgrounds/FiltersUsers shall be able to set a custom image or blurred effect as their background.FR-202Breakout RoomsThe host shall be able to automatically or manually split participants into smaller, separate meeting rooms, and bring them back to the main session.FR-203Raise Hand / ReactionsParticipants shall be able to use a "Raise Hand" function to indicate they wish to speak, and use emoji-based reactions that display over their video.FR-204In-Meeting PollingThe host shall be able to create, launch, and share the results of polls during a meeting.FR-205Annotation & WhiteboardUsers shall be able to annotate (draw, highlight, text) on a shared screen or use a dedicated digital whiteboard feature.FR-206Live TranscriptionThe system shall provide real-time automated speech-to-text transcription of the meeting conversation.C. User & Meeting ManagementIDRequirementDescriptionFR-301User AuthenticationThe platform shall support secure user registration, login (including OAuth/SSO integration for Enterprise), and profile management.FR-302Meeting SchedulingUsers shall be able to schedule meetings, generate unique meeting links/IDs, and send calendar invitations (integrating with Google/Outlook Calendars).FR-303Waiting RoomA waiting room feature shall allow the host to screen and individually admit participants before they join the main meeting.FR-304Persistent Chat (Outside Meeting)A separate, persistent instant messaging/team chat feature (like Zoom Team Chat) shall be available for communication outside of scheduled meetings.FR-305Reporting/AnalyticsHosts/Admins shall have access to reports detailing meeting usage (participants, duration, time of meeting).III. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)These define the quality and performance attributes of the system. As a solution architect, this is where you define a "world-class" solution.A. Performance & ScalabilityIDRequirementDescriptionTarget MetricNFR-101Latency (Real-Time)Video and audio latency shall be minimized to ensure natural conversation flow.$\le 150 \text{ milliseconds}$ (between nearest two peers)NFR-102AvailabilityThe platform shall be operational and accessible to all users.$99.99\%$ (Four nines)NFR-103Concurrent UsersThe core meeting service must scale elastically to handle peak loads without performance degradation.Support a $5\times$ surge in concurrent meetings/users within 30 minutes.NFR-104Connection ResilienceThe system shall automatically and seamlessly re-establish a dropped connection for a participant within a short timeframe.$\le 5 \text{ seconds}$ to rejoin the meeting on stable network recovery.NFR-105Bandwidth AdaptationThe platform must dynamically adjust video resolution and frame rate based on a participant's available bandwidth to maintain audio quality.Maintain clear audio even if video quality drops to minimum standards.B. Security & ComplianceIDRequirementDescriptionTarget MetricNFR-201Encryption (In-Transit)All media streams (video, audio, screen share) and data shall be encrypted using industry-standard protocols.$\text{AES-256 GCM}$ for media, $\text{TLS 1.2+}$ for signaling.NFR-202End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)The platform shall offer an optional mode for E2EE where meeting content is only visible to participants in the meeting.Must be available and explicitly labeled when functional limitations (e.g., cloud recording) apply.NFR-203Authentication SecurityUser credentials shall be protected.Enforce $\text{MFA}$ (Multi-Factor Authentication) for all users/admins.NFR-204Data Privacy ComplianceThe platform must adhere to relevant global data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).All PII (Personally Identifiable Information) must be stored and processed according to compliance standards.C. Usability & InteroperabilityIDRequirementDescriptionTarget MetricNFR-301Cross-Platform SupportThe application must function consistently across all major operating systems and form factors.Support for Web (WebRTC), Desktop (Windows/macOS), and Mobile (iOS/Android).NFR-302Accessibility (WCAG)The user interface must be accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation).Achieve $\text{WCAG 2.1 AA}$ compliance.NFR-303Intuitive InterfaceNew users should be able to join and start a basic meeting without prior training.$\le 5 \text{ clicks}$ to join a meeting from a shared link.NFR-304API & IntegrationsA robust $\text{API}$ shall be available for third-party integrations (e.g., CRM, LMS, custom workflows).$\text{RESTful API}$ with comprehensive documentation and $\text{OAuth 2.0}$ support.IV. Architectural & Implementation ConstraintsThese define the how of the solution, critical for a solution architect.IDRequirementDescriptionARC-101Technology StackCore real-time communication must leverage WebRTC technology for low-latency peer-to-peer and multi-party streaming (using $\text{SFU}$ architecture for scalability).ARC-102Cloud InfrastructureThe solution must be built on a scalable, modern cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, GCP, or Azure) using microservices to ensure modularity and scalability.ARC-103AI/ML IntegrationThe architecture must allow for the integration of $\text{AI}$ services for features like noise suppression, meeting summarization, and improved transcription.ARC-104Logging & MonitoringComprehensive logging, monitoring, and alerting (e.g., using a $\text{SLACK}$ stack or similar) must be in place to track performance, security, and availability metrics in real-time.ARC-105CI/CD PipelineA robust $\text{CI/CD}$ (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline shall be implemented to ensure fast, reliable, and frequent software releases and updates.
